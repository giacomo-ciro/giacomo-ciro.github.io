# Open Source
I believe one of the greatest byproducts of the internet is large-scale collaboration. It fascinates me how people around the world manage to work together to advance open-source projects. I co-founded the [Bocconi Open Source Society (BOSS)](https://b-open.dev) to promote open source at my university, and I contribute to projects whenever I can. Here are some I've worked on:

- Fixed errors in the [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) textbook by Simon J.D. Prince (The MIT Press, 2023).
- Fixed a bug in [TileDB-Vector-Search](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Vector-Search/pull/580), a library for efficient out-of-core vector search.
- Refactored an enum object in the [Conda](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/15428) package manager.

# Study Material
Below are some of the resources I have found most valuable for learning, exploring, or reviewing topics in mathematics, statistics, computer science and machine learning:

- Blogs
    - [Hugging Face Daily Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers): Daily feed of new model releases and research papers, with a focus on recent developments.

- Textbooks
    - [Applied Linear Statistical Models](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344587293_Applied_Linear_Statistical_Models) by M. H. Kutner: Foundational textbook for linear models.
    - [Operating System Concepts](https://os.ecci.ucr.ac.cr/slides/Abraham-Silberschatz-Operating-System-Concepts-10th-2018.pdf) by A. Silberschatz: Comprehensive overview of how operating systems work.
    - [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) by C. M. Bishop: Core reference for pattern recognition and machine learning concepts.
    - [System Design Interview](https://bytes.usc.edu/~saty/courses/docs/data/SystemDesignInterview.pdf) by A. Xu: Concise yet thorough overview of system design, with each chapter focusing on a well-known system and curated further readings.

# Misc
This section collects useful tips, solutions, and interesting facts I wish I'd known sooner or simply find worth sharing:

- Converting .epub to .mobi and then back to .epub can resolve *ERROR 999 Internal Problem* on Amazon Kindle. See the reference [here](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=4396847).
- There is a token count mismatch when using the Google GenAI tokenizer vs. the Google VertexAI tokenizer. See the [issue](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai/issues/1284) I opened.
- $$r = 1-\sin(\theta)$$ is a [heart curve](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html) in polar coordinates.
