        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a
          <a href="https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/master-science/artificial-intelligence">
            MSc in Artificial Intelligence
          </a> at
          <a href="https://www.unibocconi.it/en">
            Bocconi University
          </a> in Milan, Italy after having completed a 
          <a href="https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/bachelor-science/economics-management-and-computer-science">
            BSc in Economics and Computer Science</a>. </p>
        <p>My passion lies in Mathematics and Computer Science and I aim at a career in Machine Learning research, Software Engineering, and Data Science.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, I want to connect minds, not only layers. For this reason, I co-founded the first machine learning student association at my university:
          <a href="https://www.bsmachinelearning.com/">
            Bocconi Students for Machine Learning (BSML)</a>.</p>
        <p>I love studying and discovering what others have done before me, with the ultimate goal of improving the state-of-the-art and making an impact in the world I live in.</p>
        <p>I am currently doing research at the intersection of Machine Learning and Life Sciences. In particular, I am exploring how prior biological knowledge about transcriptional regulation processes can be integrated into transformer models for gene expression prediction.</p>
