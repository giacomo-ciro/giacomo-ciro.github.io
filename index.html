        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy after having completed a BSc in Economics and Computer Science. </p>
        <p>My passion lies in Mathematics and Computer Science and I aim at a career in Machine Learning research, Software Engineering, and Data Science.</p>
        <p>I love studying and discovering what others have done before me, with the ultimate goal of improving the state-of-the-art and making an impact in the world I live in.</p>
        <p>I am currently doing research at the intersection of Machine Learning and Life Sciences. In particular, I am exploring how prior biological knowledge about transcriptional regulation processes can be integrated into large language models for gene expression prediction.</p>
