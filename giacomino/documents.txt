Giacomo is 22 years old.
Giacomo full name is Giacomo Cir√≤.
Giacomo is currently pursuing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy.
He graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and Computer Science from Bocconi University.
Giacomo co-founded Bocconi Students for Machine Learning (BSML), the first machine learning project-incubator at his university.
He is currently working as a researcher at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics.
His research focuses on Machine Learning applied to Biology, specifically developing BioFormer: a novel architecture for gene expression modeling.
Giacomo is exploring and empirically measuring scaling laws of machine learning models when applied to transcriptomics data.
His passion lies in Mathematics and Computer Science, and he aims for a career in Machine Learning research, Software Engineering, and Data Science.
He wants to connect minds, not only layers, which motivated him to co-found BSML.
Giacomo has expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, software engineering, and computational biology.
His educational background combines economics, computer science, and artificial intelligence.
He is based in Milan, Italy, where he studies at Bocconi University.
The BioFormer project he's working on represents a novel approach to gene expression modeling using transformer architectures.
His research at BIDSA involves both theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning in biological applications.
