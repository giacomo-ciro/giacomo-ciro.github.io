I am currently pursuing a [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/master-science/artificial-intelligence) at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en) in Milan, Italy after having graduated cum laude with a [BSc in Economics and Computer Science](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/bachelor-science/economics-management-and-computer-science)

My passion lies in Mathematics and Computer Science and I aim at a career in Machine Learning research, Software Engineering, and Data Science.

I also want to connect minds, not only layers. For this reason, I co-founded [Bocconi Students for Machine Learning (BSML)](https://www.bsmachinelearning.com/), the first machine learning project-incubator at my university.

Currently, I am a researcher at the [Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics](https://bidsa.unibocconi.eu/?_gl=1*vwq429*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTg0NTkzNzg4LjE3MzI0ODA4MDc.*_ga_FMVFTTB8Q4*MTczMjQ4MDgwNS4xLjEuMTczMjQ4MDg3MS4wLjAuMA..), focusing on Machine Learning applications in Biology. My work centers on developing [BioFormer](https://github.com/giacomo-ciro/240316_bio-llms), an novel architecture for gene expression modeling. I am also investigating the scaling laws of machine learning models in transcriptomics.
