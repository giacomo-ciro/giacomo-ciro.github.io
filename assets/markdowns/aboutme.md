I am currently pursuing a [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/master-science/artificial-intelligence) at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en) in Milan, Italy after having graduated cum laude with a [BSc in Economics and Computer Science](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/bachelor-science/economics-management-and-computer-science).

My passion lies in Mathematics and Computer Science, and I aim at a career as Quantitative Researcher in Finance.

To refine my quantitative and research skills, I am currently working as a Machine Learning Researcher at the [Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics](https://bidsa.unibocconi.eu/?_gl=1*vwq429*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTg0NTkzNzg4LjE3MzI0ODA4MDc.*_ga_FMVFTTB8Q4*MTczMjQ4MDgwNS4xLjEuMTczMjQ4MDg3MS4wLjAuMA..) and the [AIRC Institute for Molecular Biology](https://www.ifom.eu/it/), under the supervision of Professor [Francesca Buffa](https://cs.unibocconi.eu/people/francesca-buffa). My work centers on exploring the scaling laws of deep learning models in transcriptomics and developing novel architectures for gene expression modeling.

I also want to connect minds, not only layers. For this reason, I co-founded [Bocconi Students for Machine Learning (BSML)](https://www.bsmachinelearning.com/), the first machine learning project-incubator at Bocconi University.
