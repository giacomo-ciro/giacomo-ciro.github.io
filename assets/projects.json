I used entropy of the words left at each round as the main selection criterion. On a set of 4,200 possible words, I achieved an accuracy of 100% over 50,000 total trials, with 3.7 average number of guesses to guess the word. When restricted to 500 possible words, this average number of guesses dropped down to 2.91.",
